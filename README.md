# Placeholder for unused domains

This project is dedicated as a placeholder static page for domoains that are not in use.
Build with Svelte because why not.

Images used in animation sequence were Generated by AI by accident. Why not use them for something fun?

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

> The configuration uses the svelte static adapter to generate static pages.

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
